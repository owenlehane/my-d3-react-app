            <p>Sorry this took so long. Let me give you a brief description of my website. Since the final project had to be a website I decided to make a website that has a page for every one of my assignments for this class. As you can see, the nav bar holds tabs that will redirect you to other pages for each respective assignment. </p>
            <p>Assignment 1 was not bad, as you will see I just drew some simple shapes as outlined. Assignment 3 was difficult. Implementing the logic was not too bad but getting a new image and generating the dots to land on random parts within the graph was a chalenge</p>
